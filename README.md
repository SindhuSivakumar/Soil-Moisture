# Soil-Moisture
Modelling soil moisture under different land cover types using radar and optical remote sensing

Soil Moisture (SM) is a crucial factor for understanding ecosystem dynamics, crop water availability, and climate control, which makes it more important to estimate soil moisture with high resolution. Existing soil moisture datasets from NASA/SMAP, ESA/SMOS, and EUMETSAT/ASCAT offer valuable information but suffer from low initial spatial resolution. To address this limitation, we propose a method that combines time-series Sentinel-1 C-band VV polarized data and Sentinel-2 optical data, which provide a higher spatial resolution of 10m and temporal resolution of 6 to 12 days, to map soil moisture spatially and temporally. In this study, we integrate remote sensing data with field-measured soil moisture obtained from 239 probes across various landscapes. Our objectives are two-fold: (i) to develop a soil moisture prediction model using radar and optical data, and (ii) to evaluate the model's performance for different land cover types. We employ a Random Forest (RF) regression model with six predictors: radar backscatter, NDWI, land use, soil type, soil texture, and topographic wetness. with k-fold Cross Validation for evaluation of the model. The model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 7.63 and RÂ² of 0.18. These results demonstrate the feasibility of mapping soil moisture using remote sensing data. Additionally, model interpretation using Shapley plots reveals that the model performs well for meadows and arable lands. However, in forested areas, the model exhibits low and negative impacts on soil moisture, indicating challenges in accurately estimating soil moisture solely through remote sensing approaches in densely vegetated regions. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map soil moisture with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. The developed RF model provides valuable insights into soil moisture dynamics and demonstrates the suitability of remote sensing for soil moisture estimation in certain land cover types. However, the limitations observed in forested areas underscore the need for further research and alternative approaches in densely vegetated regions.
